# Boris Bikes

This is my solo run through of the Boris Bikes challenge which I covered in week 1 of Makers' Academy. [boris-bikes-challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md). This particular solution was started at the end of week 2. You can find all my work during each individual day within the contributors list below. Each branch corresponds to a particular day where I paired with that person. Please note that all code in this repo should be treated as a WIP and each day has been spent working on a completely separate codebase.

I have aimed to solve this challenge in a test driven manner with automated feature and unit tests using RSpec.


## Brief

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. For a small fee, anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London. Bikes are located at Docking Stations dotted throughout the city.

### Welcome to Being a Developer

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (congratulations! That was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality. They call it - guess what? - 'Boris' Bikes, and they're offering a tasty sum of money.

These challenges will help to guide your first few steps when presented with any software project. There are 22 challenges, and they all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.

### User Stories

```
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked
